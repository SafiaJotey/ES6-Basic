1.var can work outside of a block scope(if,for,while but not function),let const cannot.

block scope:
A block scope is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Generally speaking, whenever you see {curly brackets}, it is a block.

2. let can be assigned multiple times but const can't


Arrow Function:
1. If it is one line code and we are not using second brackets
we don't need to return value it will return automatically.we have to return when we are writing multiple lines code or using
second brackets


Spread operator:
const array1=[5,8,9,40];
const array2=[...array];
1.using third brackets again creating a array
2.creating new address array array2 using the same value of array1
const array3=array;
3. copy the reference that is address,and create array3
